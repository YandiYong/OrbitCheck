## 1. Executive Summary
The Emergency Trolley Checklist System digitizes daily trolley checks, item usage tracking, expiry monitoring, replacement workflows, and checklist completion records.

This replaces manual, paper-heavy processes with a single operational view that improves readiness, compliance, and accountability while reducing avoidable stock-outs and expired-item risk.

## 2. Problem Statement
Current manual checklist and inventory processes create operational and compliance risks:
- Inconsistent checklist completion across shifts
- Delayed visibility of expired or soon-to-expire items
- Limited traceability of usage and replacements
- Higher chance of emergency trolley unavailability when needed
- Time lost in manual counting and follow-up

## 3. Proposed Solution
Implement and use the Emergency Trolley Checklist System as the standard daily workflow:
- Structured checklist execution by session (morning/afternoon/emergency)
- Live inventory and category views for quick navigation
- Usage dialog to count and validate item availability
- Expiry and replacement management with guided actions
- Stored daily snapshots and session history for audit support

## 4. Business Objectives
1. Improve emergency trolley readiness and patient safety support.
2. Increase checklist compliance and consistency across teams.
3. Reduce stock-outs, expiries, and unplanned replacement delays.
4. Strengthen operational reporting and accountability.
5. Reduce administrative time spent on manual reconciliation.

## 5. Key Benefits
### Operational
- Faster daily checks through a guided interface
- Earlier identification of shortages and expiring items
- Better shift handover clarity through session records

### Clinical and Safety Support
- Better likelihood that required items are present and in date
- Lower risk of emergency delays caused by missing stock

### Compliance and Governance
- Clear digital evidence of checklist completion and changes
- Improved traceability for internal audits and reviews

### Financial
- Lower waste from expired inventory
- Reduced urgent/procurement exceptions from late detection

## 6. Scope
### In Scope
- Daily emergency trolley checklist workflow
- Inventory item status visibility
- Usage counting, review, and confirmation
- Replacement and expiry-date updates
- Session and checklist snapshot storage

### Out of Scope (for this phase)
- Enterprise ERP/procurement integration
- Multi-site cross-organization reporting dashboards
- Automated supplier ordering

## 7. Stakeholders
- Nursing and clinical operations teams
- Unit/ward managers
- Pharmacy and stock control teams
- Quality/compliance and audit functions
- IT/application support

## 8. Success Measures (KPIs)
- Checklist completion rate by day/shift
- Percentage of required items available at check time
- Number of expired items found during checks
- Time to resolve flagged shortages/replacements
- Reduction in emergency stock-related incidents

## 9. Recommendation
Proceed with adoption as the standard emergency trolley checking process.

A phased rollout with training and KPI tracking is expected to deliver measurable improvements in readiness, safety support, compliance evidence, and inventory efficiency within the first operational cycle.
